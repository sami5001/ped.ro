title: 'Migrating from Rebass to Wallop System'

Last year I talked at [JAMstack meetup](https://www.meetup.com/JAMstack-London/events/257961818/) in London. As part of this talk, I created an online guide to help people get started with JAMstack, it's called [jamstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf).

I built it with [Rebass](https://rebassjs.org). If you're not familiar with Rebass, it's a React UI Library. It's one of many projects by [Brent Jackson](https://jxnblk.com/), and it's powered by [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/).

At the time it was the right tool for the job. But the times are a changing! I now have [Wallop System](/blog/wallop-system-built-with-modulz), which is my own design system.

It's time to migrate from Rebass to Wallop System.

Wallop System was created, developed and deployed with [Modulz](https://modulz.app). Design systems generated by Modulz have a similar API to Styled System and [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com), but with a few differences.

> The migration from Rebass to Wallop would be the same for any Modulz generated design system

## Props

The first class support of system props in Rebass and Wallop System are different. With Rebass, you can use the following props on all components:

- `margin`, `marginTop`, `mt`, `marginRight`, `mr`, `marginBottom`, `mb`, `marginLeft`, `ml`, `marginX`, `mx`, `marginY`, `my`
- `padding`, `paddingTop`, `pt`, `paddingRight`, `pr`, `paddingBottom`, `pb`, `paddingLeft`, `pl`, `paddingX`, `px`, `paddingY`, `py`
- `color`
- `backgroundColor`, `bg`
- `opacity`
- `width`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`
- `height`, `minHeight`, `maxWHeight`
- `size`,
- `overflow`, `overflowX`, `overflowY`
- `display`
- `verticalAlign`
- `fontFamily`
- `fontSize`
- `fontWeight`
- `lineHeight`
- `letterSpacing`
- `textAlign`
- `fontStyle`
- `alignItems`
- `alignContent`
- `justifyContent`
- `flexWrap`
- `flexBasis`
- `flexDirection`
- `flex`
- `justifySelf`
- `alignItems`
- `order`
- `sx`

In addition to the above, the Rebass' `Tile` component also supports:

- `columns`
- `gap`

With Wallop System, you can use the following props on all components:

- `margin`, `marginTop`, `mt`, `marginRight`, `mr`, `marginBottom`, `mb`, `marginLeft`, `ml`, `marginX`, `mx`, `marginY`, `my`
- `padding`, `paddingTop`, `pt`, `paddingRight`, `pr`, `paddingBottom`, `pb`, `paddingLeft`, `pl`, `paddingX`, `px`, `paddingY`, `py`
- `sx`

### Why only three?

- **Typescript**: some system props can clash with a valid HTML attributes. For example, `size` is a valid HTML attribute of an `input` element, but it's also a system prop. System props support the responsive syntax, and HTML attributes don't. So, `<Input size={["small", "large"]}` would result in a Typescript error.
- **Best practices**: when props are first class citizens it implies that they _should_ be used, but design systems generated by Modulz have already been fully styled, so overrides should be kept to a minimum
- **Predictable**: not all system props make sense on all components. For example, passing a `fontSize` to a `Radio` wouldn't do anything, since the Radio component doesn't render a text node, but an `input`
- **Simple API**: we want to keep the API surface area simple to learn and consistent across all components

Any CSS can still be passed in via the `sx` prop, and by default the values are theme-bound, just like system props.

## In practice

Now that we've established the key API differences, let's look at how to migrate from one to another:

### Rebass

```jsx
<Box px={[4, 5, 6]} py={[4, 5]} bg="black" color="white">
  <Text as="h1" fontSize={[2, 3]}>
    JAMstack
  </Text>
</Box>
```

### Wallop System

```jsx{1,2}
<Box px={[4, 5, 6]} py={[4, 5]} sx={{ bg: 'black', color: 'white' }}>
  <Text as="h1" sx={{ fontSize: [2, 3] }}>
    JAMstack
  </Text>
</Box>
```

Have a look at the [full migration PR](https://github.com/peduarte/jamstack-wtf/pull/14/) is on Github, where you can see many more examples.

I love how compatible the APIs are. I hope that one day we can have full [interoperability](https://jxnblk.com/blog/interoperability/) in UI systems.
